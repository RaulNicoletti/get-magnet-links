This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Extension](https://github.com/RaulNicoletti/create-react-extension).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
You can now load the `dev` folder in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and your app is ready to be deployed!
